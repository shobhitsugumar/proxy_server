WHat is a Proxy-server ? 
 - Proxy servers act as middlemen, communicating your needs and requests without providing your information to the internet. Proxies can also allow you to bypass certain security blocks and allow you to access information that might otherwise be blocked. This is made possible through the use of a proxy server that does not reveal your personal IP address.
